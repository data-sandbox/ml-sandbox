# Machine Learning Mini Projects

Sandbox for experimenting with machine learning concepts and methods.

- [Clustering](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/blob/main/clustering/clustering.ipynb) - Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique to find interesting patterns or groups in data. Experiments with KMeans and Gaussian Mixture models.
- [Classification: Customer Churn](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/tree/main/customer_churn) - Build a classification model to detect customer churn. Explores Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Unbalanced Classes in the process.
- [Classification: Multiple Classes](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/tree/main/diamond_quality) - Build a multiclass classification model to predict diamond cut quality. Explores Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost techniques.
- [Recommender System](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/tree/main/movie_recommender) - Recommender systems utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques. This project aims to build a movie recommendation engine using Nearest Neighbors.
- [ROC](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/blob/main/roc_auc/roc_curves.ipynb) - Experiments with the ROC Curve to determine an optimal output threshold for classification, output threshold as a hyperparameter, and comparison of ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve.
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-sandbox/tree/main/sentiment_amazon) - Explore scratch-built Natural Language Processing (NLP) model vs. pre-trained Hugging Face model for sentiment analysis (is the review positive or negative?) of Amazon reviews.
